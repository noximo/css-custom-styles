# css-custom-styles
Custom styles for various websites

It's done in a way that works for me, with my resolution, hides functions I don't use etc. But feel free to fork/copy and adapt.

I'm using it with https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-css/okpjlejfhacmgjkmknjhadmkdbcldfcb but I don't see a reason why it wouldn't work with other extensions.
